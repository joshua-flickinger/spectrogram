# spectrogram
In 2018, I participated in a [contest](https://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/spec.html) to create an R code using the [seewave](https://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/) R package for generating a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram).  The package didn't have a built in function to create a spectrogam with an associated oscillogram, so my entry in the contest focused on combining both graph types in a plot grid.

For the spectrogram, I used a sound clip of a Canyon Wren.  The clip is in the creative commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) and was originally uploaded to xeno-canto.org by Bobby Wilcox.  The file can be downloaded from this link:
